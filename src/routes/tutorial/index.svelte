  <title>MaxTo tutorial</title>
</svelte:head>
<h1>The <b>tutorial</b> is meant to get you up to speed on what MaxTo has to offer.</h1>

<p>
  As with most tutorials, we start with the assumption that you've never used MaxTo before, and gradually build from there.
  We'll teach you about regions, keyboard shortcuts, recipes, the command line and how MaxTo can help you with virtual desktops.
