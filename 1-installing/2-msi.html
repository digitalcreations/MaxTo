    <p class="lead">Use the MSI installer to install MaxTo for a wide set of users in your enterprise.</p>

    <section class="important">
        <p>The MSI installer package is not intended for ordinary installations of MaxTo. If you don't know what Group
            Policy is, use <a href="1-setup.html">the normal installer instead</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <p>When you install the MSI package, all the users on the machine will get their own copy of MaxTo installed the
        next time they log in.</p>

    <p>It is important to note that when you run the MSI package, it will appear to do nothing (besides asking you for administrative permissions).</p>

    <h2>Known pitfalls when deploying the MSI package</h2>

        <dl>
            <dt>Nothing happens when users log in</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    The MSI package will not re-install MaxTo on login for users who have previously uninstalled MaxTo.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It does this by checking for the existence of the <code>%LocalAppData%\MaxTo</code> folder. If this folder exists, MaxTo will not be installed on login.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To get around this issue, delete the <code>%LocalAppData%\MaxTo</code> folder for the affected user profiles.

            <dt>User installation of .NET Framework fails</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    MaxTo requires .NET Framework version 4.7.2. The normal installer (which is what the MSI runs on login) will attempt to install this dependency if it is not already installed. This can fail in some cases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We strongly recommend deploying the .NET Framework version 4.7.2 in addition to MaxTo.
