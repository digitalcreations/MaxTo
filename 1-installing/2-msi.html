<p class="lead">Use the MSI installer to install MaxTo for a wide set of users in your enterprise.</p>

<section class="important">
    <p>The MSI installer package is not meant for ordinary installations of MaxTo. If you don't know what Group Policy is, use <a href="1-setup.html">the normal installer instead</a>.</p>
</section>

<p>When you install the MSI package, all the users on the machine will get their own copy of MaxTo installed the next time they log in.</p>
