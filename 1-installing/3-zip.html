    <p class="lead">The ZIP installation package lets you put MaxTo wherever you want, but you no longer get automatic
        updates.</p>

    <aside class="important">
        <p><b>System requirements</b></p>
        <p>When you use the ZIP archive, you are responsible for having the required dependencies installed. You need
            to install the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime">.NET Framework
                4.7.2</a> or later. </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
        The archive contains all the files required to run MaxTo. All the files inside are digitally signed, so you can
        verify that they came from us.
    </p>

    <h3>Setting the path</h3>

    <p>
        If you want to use the CLI, you'll need to add the installation folder to your path. This is the recommended
        way to do this (on Windows 10):
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Hit <kbd>Windows+Pause/Break</kbd> on your keyboard. This opens the System Control Panel window.</li>
        <li>In the left column, click <em>Advanced system settings</em>.</li>
        <li>On the bottom of the page that opens, click <em>Environment Variables</em>.</li>
        <li>In the window that opens, in the top half, find the variable called <code>Path</code> and click <em>Edit...</em></li>
        <li>Click <em>Browse...</em> and select your MaxTo installation folder.</li>
        <li>Now <em>OK</em> your way out of all the open windows.</li>
        <li>Start a new instance of <em>Command Prompt</em>. The change will not affect prompts that were already open.</li>
    </ol>

    <section class="note">
        <p>
            MaxTo does not work with side-by-side installs. It will only allow one version to run at a time.
