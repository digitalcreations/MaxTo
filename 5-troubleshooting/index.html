    <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

    <p class="lead">If you should encounter any issues with MaxTo, here are some steps to help you identify what is happening.</p>

    <section class="important">
        <p>Some of these steps require advanced PC knowledge. We will explain as clearly as we can, and will be clear whenever we suggest doing anything destructive.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Log files</h2>

    <p>
        MaxTo produces quite log data when it is installed and running. These are the locations where you can expect to find useful information should you experience a crash or unexpected behavior:
    </p>

    <h3>Runtime logs</h3>

    <p>
        This log file contains entries about what MaxTo is doing at specific points in time, including any crashes that MaxTo experience. You will find this file in <code>%AppData%\MaxTo\maxto.log</code>.
    </p>

    <section class="note">
        <p>You can see the file paths we specify contain special variables (such as <code>%AppData%</code>). These expand into full paths on your machine, but can be different from computer to computer.</p>
        <p>To quickly open the log file, hit Windows+R on your keyboard, and copy in the path to the file. Then press OK, and the file should open in your default text editor (usually Notepad).</p>
    </section>

<p>
    Each line in this file is timestamped; and the file may grow quite large. If you can reliably reproduce your issue, it could be helpful to delete the log file before trying to reproduce the issue &mdash; that way there will be less data for us to read when we try to figure out what is going on.
</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from the log file, with specific bits of information highlighted:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">2018-11-26 21:36:42 [MaxTo.Core@2.0.0.0] [Information] 3 processes started

<p>Each line has a log level, which indicates the severity of what is being reported. The log levels are, in order from least to most important:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Debug</dt>
    <dd>Trivial events that specify in very intricate detail what is being done.</dd>
    <dt>Information</dt>
    <dd>Events that carry information about normal program behavior.</dd>
    <dt>Warning</dt>
    <dd>Events that may indicate something is off; but may be totally trivial.</dd>
    <dt>Error</dt>
    <dd>Something went wrong, but not badly enough that the program crashed.</dd>
    <dt>Fatal</dt>
    <dd>Something went so wrong that MaxTo couldn't recover and exited.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Installation logs</h3>

    <p>
        If you use the normal installer, it generates a log file during installation in <code>%LocalAppData%\SquirrelTemp\SquirrelSetup.log</code>.
    </p>

    <section class="note">
        <p>Note that the installation log may also contain information about other programs on your machine; as other program may use the same installer as MaxTo does.</p>
