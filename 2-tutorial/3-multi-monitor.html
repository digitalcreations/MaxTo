    <h1>Multiple monitors</h1>
    <aside class="aside">
        <p>Did you know you can change how MaxTo identifies your monitors? See
            <a href="../3-configuration/3-monitor.html">monitor identification</a> for more details.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>The multi-monitor support in Windows has really come a long way in the years that MaxTo has been around. With
        Windows 10 and MaxTo, the multi-monitor support is brilliant.</p>
    <p>When you set up your regions; MaxTo will show the region divider screen on each of your monitors. Each monitor
        will have its own set of regions, and you can choose to only set up regions on some of your monitors.</p>

    <h2>Per-monitor DPI-awareness</h2>
    <p>
        MaxTo supports multiple monitors running at different scaling settings, known as per-monitor DPI awareness.
        This means that it should be
        trivial to connect your 4K laptop to a stationary full-HD display, and things should work exactly as you
        expect.

        <p>
            We strongly recommend running Windows 10 (and keeping it up to date) if you have monitors running at
            different scaling levels. This is because Microsoft's support for
            mixed-mode DPI scaling has been mediocre at best in previous versions of Windows.
