<p>The multi-monitor support in Windows has really come a long way in the  years that MaxTo has been around. With Windows 10 and MaxTo, the multi-monitor support is brilliant.</p>
<p>When you set up your regions; MaxTo will show the region divider screen on each of your monitors. Each monitor will have its own set of regions, and you can choose to only set up regions on some of your monitors.</p>
