    <title>Using MaxTo</title>

    <h1>These are the basics</h1>
    <p class="lead">Your day-to-day operation of your computer will be somewhat different than what it was.</p>

    <p>
        MaxTo has been designed to be somewhat invisible in day-to-day use. This means that unless you are changing settings, you won't see any MaxTo windows.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main way MaxTo works is by listening for windows that are maximized, and then redirecting the window to the closest region. You'll find this works with (almost) any software.
    </p>

    <p>
        It can however be difficult to remember which regions are active, so a lot of people use a different way of interacting with MaxTo. If you hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> while moving a window, MaxTo will show you the region where the window will be placed if you drop it.
    </p>

        <p><b>Psst!</b> Make sure you keep holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> until you let go of the mouse button.</p>

    <p>
        If you want to change your regions, you'll need to find the MaxTo icon in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notification_area">the notification area</a>. Double-click the icon to change the regions; or right-click to <a href="../3-configuration/index.html">change your settings</a>.
