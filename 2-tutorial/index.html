    <p class="lead">MaxTo lets you work differently with your windows, but you have to learn our terminology first.</p>
    <p>MaxTo originated as a simple way to intercept whenever a window in the system was maximized, and putting that window into a predefined region instead of the entire screen. It has since added quite a few different features, but this core remains.</p>
    <div class="note">
        <p>A <em>region</em> is a rectangular area of the screen.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This lets you very quickly line up your windows the way you want them. And it doesn't waste a single pixel of screen space.</p>
    <p>When you install MaxTo you divide the working area of your monitors into regions. These <em>active regions</em> define where your windows will go.</p>
    <h2>Setting up regions</h2>
    <p>When MaxTo first starts, and you've walked through the welcome screen, you'll be presented with a screen that looks something like this.</p>
    <figure class="figure">

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">The monitor setup screen, showing two default regions next to each other horizontally.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div class="aside">
        <p>For the programmers out there, the regions are actually a binary tree, with the nodes being your regions.</p>
    </div>
