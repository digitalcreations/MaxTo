    <h1>Tutorial</h1>

    <p class="lead">MaxTo lets you work differently with your windows, but you have to learn our terminology first.</p>
    <p>MaxTo originated as a simple way to intercept whenever a window in the system was maximized, and putting that
        window into a predefined region instead of the entire screen. It has since added quite a few different
        features, but this core remains.</p>
    <div class="note">
        <p>A <em>region</em> is a rectangular area of the screen.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This lets you very quickly line up your windows the way you want them. And it doesn't waste a single pixel of
        screen space.</p>
    <p>When you install MaxTo you divide the working area of your monitors into regions. These <em>active regions</em>
        define where your windows will go.</p>

    <h2>Your first regions</h2>
    <p>When MaxTo first starts, and you've walked through the welcome screen, you'll be presented with a screen that
        looks something like this.</p>
    <figure class="figure">
        <p><img src="../images/tutorial/regions.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="The region divider screen" /></p>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">The monitor setup screen, showing two default regions next to each other
            horizontally.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        This is where you set up your regions. In total, your regions cover the entire working area of the monitor,
        there are no gaps.
    </p>
    <aside>
        <p>In the screenshot, you can see that the dimensions are given twice. Because of <em>display scaling</em> on
            newer monitors, one pixel on the monitor does not always equal what one program sees as one pixel.</p>
        <p>This is known as <em>device pixels</em> (what is actually on the monitor) and logical pixels (what Windows
            tells you is the size).</p>
        <p>MaxTo prioritizes device pixels here, and the smaller number below indicates the size in logical pixels.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>
        Each region has its size dimensions in the middle. Above there are two buttons that let you split that region
        into two, either horizontally or vertically.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also join regions into one; click the eraser button to remove the line between two regions and join
        them.
    </p>

    <p>
        It can be difficult to know what layout will work for you, so to get a feeling for how you will use MaxTo,
        simply set up your active regions in the manner you think is best. You can always go back and change it later.
