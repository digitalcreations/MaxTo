title: Normal installer
---

When you run the standard MaxTo installer, MaxTo will be installed automatically for your user account on the machine.

It will be installed into `%LocalAppData%\MaxTo`, and it will keep MaxTo up to date, checking for updates every time MaxTo is started. You can also check for updates manually through the settings.

MaxTo will start immediately after you've run the installer. It should only take about a second to install.
