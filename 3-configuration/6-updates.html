    <p class="lead">MaxTo will update itself if you give it a chance.</p>

        <p>
            Automatic updates are not available if you install MaxTo using the ZIP archive.
        </p>
    </section>

    <p>
        You can disable MaxTo's automatic updates if you for any reason feel like you need to stick to the version you
        have currently.

        <h3>A note on updates</h3>

        <p>
            Currently, MaxTo checks for updates every time it is started. If an update is available, it will be
            downloaded and installed.
            The next time you start MaxTo, the update will be applied.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are currently no information in the user interface presented when an update has been installed or is
            ready to install.
            We are working on this.

    <h2>Update channel</h2>

    <p>
        You can pick if you want to receive updates as we are testing, or if you want to wait until everything is
        stable. If you want to be on the bleeding edge and try out new features early, you can try out the
        <em>Beta</em> or <em>Alpha</em> update channels.
