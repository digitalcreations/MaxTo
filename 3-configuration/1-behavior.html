    <h1>Window behavior</h1>
    <p class="lead">MaxTo has some nice tricks to make resizing windows even easier.</p>

    <h2>Window transparency</h2>

    <aside>
        <p>Personally I use the window transparency quite a lot to test if MaxTo is running as it should (but I guess that is only useful for me as a developer).</p>
    </aside>
    
    <p>
        When you move or resize a window, MaxTo can make the window partially transparent. This makes it possible to see what is behind the window you are moving.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you find this feature distracting, you can turn it off in the Settings, or set <code>behavior.transparentWindowsWhenMoving</code> to <code>false</code> in the config file.
    </p>

    <h2>Window snapping</h2>

    <p>
        Snapping applies when you are resizing or moving a window. When one of the edges of the window you are moving comes within range of a snappable edge, the edges will snap together.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using these settings you control what can be snapped to.

            <dt>Window edges</dt>
            <dd>The borders of windows, but only the ones that are currently not obscured by other windows on top of them.</dd>

            <dt>Region edges</dt>
            <dd>The borders of the currently active regions. These may be invisible to you, unless you have windows in all your regions. Because they may be invisible, this is turned off by default.</dd>

            <dt>Monitor edges</dt>
            <dd>These are the sides of your monitors' working area.</dd>
