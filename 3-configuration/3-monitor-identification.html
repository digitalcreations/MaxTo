    <h1>Monitor identification</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        You can pick between multiple ways to identify your monitors in MaxTo.
    </p>

    <p>
        MaxTo has been designed to work as well as possible with multiple monitors. This means that we need to
        have a unique identifier for each of your monitors.
    </p>

    <section class="note">
        <p>
            Note that in this document, we are talking about how monitors are identified in configuration files
        and internally in MaxTo. <b>This does not affect the user interface, but it affects behavior.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            For almost every user we recommend leaving this setting at its default, which is identifying
            by serial number.
        </p>
    </section>

    <p>
        Monitor identification is important because it is how MaxTo links a set of regions to a monitor.
    </p>

    <h2>Device names &mdash; how Windows identifies monitors</h2>
    <p>
        Windows assigns each monitor a <i>device name</i>. This usually takes the form <code>\\.\DISPLAY1</code>,
        and as you can guess the number increases the more monitors you connect to your machine. The device name
        is unique on one machine, but they are not tied to a specific monitor.
    </p>

    <p>
        The device name is actually linked to the output port the monitor is connected to, numbered how your 
        video driver wants it. This means that your device name for a monitor can change if:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>You connect another monitor that gets given a lower number.</li>
        <li>You swap around which monitor is connected where.</li>
        <li>A monitor is disconnected, either because it is turned off or the cable is removed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Property identification</h2>

    <p>
        The next step up from the device name, is trying to identify a monitor uniquely by 
        looking at its properties. The properties MaxTo looks at when trying to identify a monitor are:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>The friendly name (human-readable name of the monitor make and model)</li>
        <li>Video card port it is connected to</li>
        <li>Resolution (inc. DPI)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This is a good first step towards better monitor identification, but it has some pitfalls.
        If you move the monitor cable to a different port on the video card, MaxTo will not recognize
        the monitor.
    </p>

    <h2>Serial numbers</h2>
    
    <aside class="aside">
        A <i>serial number</i> is a unique number assigned by the manufacturer that identifies that
        specific monitor. Two monitors of the same make and model should always have distinct
        serial numbers.
    </aside>

    <p>
        The best possible way MaxTo could work, would allow you to share your settings across
        multiple computers, and once you plug in a monitor MaxTo has seen before, no matter
        at which video card port, MaxTo will load the regions that were last active on that
        monitor. This is what identifying by the monitor's serial number does.
    </p>

    <section class="note">
        <p>
            Not all monitors present their serial number, and some video cards do not provide this
        information. For monitors where this is the case, MaxTo will fall back to identifying
        that monitor by its properties.
