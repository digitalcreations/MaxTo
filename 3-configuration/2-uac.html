    <section class="note">
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control">User account control</a> (<abbr title="User Account Control">UAC</abbr>) is a security feature that was introduced in Windows Vista. When <abbr title="User Account Control">UAC</abbr> is turned on, user accounts run most programs with restricted permissions.</p>
        <p>Some programs still require administrative permissions, and when a program asks for these <strong>elevated</strong> permissions, the <abbr title="User Account Control">UAC</abbr> elevation dialog appears.</p>

    <p>If you want MaxTo to be able to affect software that is running elevated, MaxTo itself needs to be running elevated. There is a setting for MaxTo to run elevated when it starts.</p>
    <p>If you experience that MaxTo doesn't work with specific programs that are running elevated, this is most likely the reason.</p>
    <section class="important">
        <p>Please note that any program which runs elevated has access to <em>everything</em> on your machine.</p>
