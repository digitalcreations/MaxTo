    <h1>Monitor settings</h1>

    <aside class="important">
        If you change any of these settings, your regions will appear to reset. This happens because MaxTo now looks
        for the regions for
        a monitor in a different location. If you change the settings back, your old regions will reappear.
    </aside>

    <p class="lead">
        You can change how MaxTo internally identifies monitors, and if you want to have separate regions on separate
        virtual desktops.
    </p>

    <h2>Monitor identification</h2>

    <p>
        MaxTo has been designed to work as well as possible with multiple monitors. This means that we need to
        have a unique identifier for each of your monitors.
    </p>

    <section class="note">
        <p>
            Note that in this document, we are talking about how monitors are identified in configuration files
            and internally in MaxTo. <b>This does not affect the user interface, but it affects behavior.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            For almost every user we recommend leaving this setting at its default, which is identifying
            by serial number.
        </p>
    </section>

    <p>
        Monitor identification is important because it is how MaxTo links a set of regions to a monitor.
    </p>

    <h3>Device names &mdash; how Windows identifies monitors</h3>
    <p>
        Windows assigns each monitor a <i>device name</i>. This usually takes the form <code>\\.\DISPLAY1</code>,
        and as you can guess the number increases the more monitors you connect to your machine. The device name
        is unique on one machine, but they are not tied to a specific monitor.
    </p>

    <p>
        The device name is actually linked to the output port the monitor is connected to, numbered how your
        video driver wants it. This means that your device name for a monitor can change if:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>You connect another monitor that gets given a lower number.</li>
        <li>You swap around which monitor is connected where.</li>
        <li>A monitor is disconnected, either because it is turned off or the cable is removed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Property identification</h3>

    <p>
        The next step up from the device name, is trying to identify a monitor uniquely by
        looking at its properties. The properties MaxTo looks at when trying to identify a monitor are:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>The friendly name (human-readable name of the monitor make and model)</li>
        <li>Video card port it is connected to</li>
        <li>Resolution (inc. DPI)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This is a good first step towards better monitor identification, but it has some pitfalls.
        If you move the monitor cable to a different port on the video card, MaxTo will not recognize
        the monitor.
    </p>

    <h3>Serial numbers</h3>

    <aside>
        A <i>serial number</i> is a unique number assigned by the manufacturer that identifies the
        specific monitor. Two monitors of the same make and model should always have distinct
        serial numbers.
    </aside>

    <p>
        The best possible way MaxTo could work, would allow you to share your settings across
        multiple computers, and once you plug in a monitor MaxTo has seen before, no matter
        at which video card port, MaxTo will load the regions that were last active on that
        monitor. This is what identifying by the monitor's serial number does.
    </p>

    <section class="note">
        <p>
            Not all monitors present their serial number, and some video cards do not provide this
            information. For monitors where this is the case, MaxTo will fall back to identifying
            that monitor by its properties.
        </p>

    <h2>Virtual desktops</h2>

    <aside>
        <p>
            Windows keyboard shortcuts for using virtual desktops:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt><kbd>Windows+Control+Left/Right</kbd></dt>
            <dd>Moves to the virtual desktop in that direction</dd>

            <dt><kbd>Windows+Control+D</kbd></dt>
            <dd>Create a new virtual desktop</dd>

            <dt><kbd>Windows+Control+F4</kbd></dt>
            <dd>Remove the current virtual desktop</dd>
        </dl>
    </aside>

    <p>
        With Windows 10, Microsoft introduced a feature known as
        <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028538/windows-10-multiple-desktops">Virtual Desktops</a>.
        This feature lets you pretend to have more monitors than you have, by keeping separate windows on each virtual
        desktop, and letting you quickly switch between them.
    </p>

    <p>
        MaxTo can set up separate regions on each virtual desktop, or you can keep the same regions on all of them.
        Using this setting, this becomes easier to control.
    </p>

    <section class="important">
        <p>
            Note that virtual desktops are not numbered, even though Windows makes it appear as if they are. This means
            that if you remove and create a virtual desktop,
            MaxTo will see the created virtual desktop as a completely new virtual desktop, because of how Windows
            works internally.
