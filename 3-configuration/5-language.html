    <h1>Language</h1>
    <p class="lead">Most of MaxTo's user interface is translated.</p>

    <p>
        You can change MaxTo's user interface language, or leave MaxTo to use the system default (if we have a
        translation for that language).
    </p>

    <section class="note">
        <p>
            Changing the language will not take effect until MaxTo is restarted.
        </p>
    </section>

    <p>
        Some parts of MaxTo will not be translated. These parts are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Log output</b>. Logs should be readable by us if you encounter an issue.</li>
        <li><b>Command names and arguments.</b> The commands should be runnable no matter what language settings you
            have.</li>
    </ul>
