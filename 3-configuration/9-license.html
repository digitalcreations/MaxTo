    <h1>License</h1>
    <p class="lead">Adding your license lets us know that you have purchased MaxTo.</p>

    <p>
        Your license key for MaxTo looks like a long word of seemingly random characters. It is in fact so long that
        you are not meant to ever type it in yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your license key is available to you in 3 places:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Immediately after your purchase, next to your receipt.</li>
        <li>In a separate e-mail sent to you immediately after purchase, with the subject <q>MaxTo license information</q>.
            The email will be sent from <q>support@maxto.net</q></li>
        <li>By <a href="/account/login">logging in</a> on this website with the e-mail you used when you purchased.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Copy your license key and enter it into this field. MaxTo will decode and save it for you.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have internet connectivity, MaxTo will go online and verify your license. The license keys are
        cryptographically signed, so they also work without internet access.
    </p>

        <h3>Legacy license keys</h3>

        <p>
            Do you have a license key consisting of two parts, <b>Registered to</b> and <b>Product key</b>?
            In that case you will need to upgrade your legacy license key (which will still be valid for version
            2017.07 and older) for a new one.
        </p>

        <p>
            Upgrading your license key to the new format is free.
