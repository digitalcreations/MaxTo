    <h1>Error reporting</h1>
    <p class="lead">Crashes in MaxTo do happen, even though we do everything we can to prevent it.</p>

    <p>
        One of the things we do is collect crash reports from anyone who runs MaxTo on their machine. Because of
        privacy concerns, you can of course disable this feature.
    </p>

    <p>
        The crash reports do not contain personally identifiable information (outside of what we mention below), and is
        only shared with Raygun (see their <a href="https://raygun.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>).
        We use the Raygun service to keep track of which crashes to fix first, based on how many machines are
        experiencing an error.

            <dd>We generate a completely random identifier, and store it on your machine. If you experience an error

                problem.</dd>
