    <h1>Command line</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        The command line interface to MaxTo is new in version 2.0, and it is very powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
        With MaxTo's command line, you can do anything you can do in a recipe; even run other recipes.
    </p>

            If you used <a href="../1-installing/1-setup.html">the normal installer</a>, the CLI works out of the
            (non-existent) box.
            If you used the ZIP archive, you will need to do <a href="../1-installing/3-zip.html">some extra setup
                yourself</a>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <p>
        Getting started with the CLI is easy, but getting to know all the commands may not be. For now, open up <em>Command
            Prompt</em>
        and type <code>maxto</code>.
    </p>

        Great, we got hold of MaxTo. Most of the options presented here are actually commands, so you can run these as
        if you were in a recipe.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's try centering the <em>Command Prompt</em> window on the current monitor.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="shell">C:\>maxto window center
Success: MaxTo.Core.Commands.Window.CenterCommand+Result</code></pre>

    <p>
        When you executed this command without arguments, it takes the foreground window (which is the <em>Command
            Prompt</em> window) and moves
        it to the center of the current monitor.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each command, there is a detailed help page available. If you don't know how a command works, you can
        simply type <code>maxto help &lt;command&gt;</code>, and MaxTo will present your options.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="shell">C:\>maxto help window focus
MaxTo CLI version 2.0.0.366
Command
Focus on window

Description
Move the focus to a window in a specific direction.

Syntax
maxto window focus
    [/Window &lt;value&gt;]
    [/Direction &lt;value&gt;]

Parameters
/Window &lt;value&gt;     The window you want to receive the focus. If Direction is
                    specified in addition to this, it specifies the window to
                    use for the starting position.
                    
                    You can find windows by specific the exact window title,
                    the exact window class, or the window handle (in
                    hexadecimal, formatted as "0xdeadbeef".

/Direction &lt;value&gt;  In which direction we should look for windows.</code></pre>

    <p>
        So if you want to move the focus to the window to your right, the correct command would be <code>maxto window
            focus /Direction Right</code>.
